## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Computer Science graduate student at the University of Southern California and student researcher at USC ICT, where my studies are generously supported by the Fulbright, The Promising Turks and Keith Uncapher Scholarships. My educational path began at KoÃ§ University in Turkey, where I earned degrees in Electrical & Electronics Engineering and Media & Visual Arts, reflecting my deep interest in blending technology with creative design.

My research spans a broad spectrum, including immersive technologies, serious games, human-computer interaction, wearable sensors, and signal processing. This diversity mirrors my belief in the vast potential of technology to not only entertain but also address critical issues in medicine, education, humanitarian efforts, data visualization, and professional fields.

â€‹Driven by the desire to create meaningful societal impact, I am dedicated to developing immersive experiences that are not only engaging but also socially transformative. I am eager to continue exploring how thoughtful application of technology can improve lives and shape a better future.

I also really enjoy bouldering, hiking, and relaxing at the beautiful beaches around Los Angeles.

Please feel free to reach out to me at bedincer17@gmail.com.
